  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>
    This project is one of the first websites I created as part of my Bachelor's degree.  
    I contributed to both the programming and the UI/UX design of the website.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Concept and Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    In the 2000s, Israel had two major TV providers: <strong>Hot</strong> and <strong>Yes</strong>.  
    Each provider offered exclusive shows that shaped the childhoods of many Israelis.  
    Our website highlights these exclusive shows, as well as programs that were available on both platforms.
